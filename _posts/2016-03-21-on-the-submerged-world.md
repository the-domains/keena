description: "As I write, a hard rain is pelting against yesterday's snow, and patches of dark green, wet stone, fallen twigs are visible just beneath fields of translucent ice. A world, submerged, slowly reveals itself. It reminds me of what it is to make a book - or, perhaps, what it is to live a life."
