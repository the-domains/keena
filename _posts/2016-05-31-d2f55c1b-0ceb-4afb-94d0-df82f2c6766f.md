![16x20 in oil painting, done with a palette knife, of a curious female grizzly bear. ](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/21f85425-4425-469a-b047-de4a80246d9c.jpg)

A curious young female grizzly rears up on two legs to get a better view over the long grasses and sedges of the coastal meadow. What does she see? 

This lusciously textured impasto oil painting is done exclusively with a palette knife. And at 20x16 inches is the perfect size to fit anywhere in your home or office. Show your wild side and bring home Little Miss Sunshine today :)

$794 CAD. Will be ready to ship in time for Christmas (this painting is hot off the easel and needs to dry first!).
