## Guiding Principles

These values are the principles that guide my company and my artwork, and that is the lodestar that attracts clients and art-lovers._Note: Wild Soul's values may be rooted in Eastern philosophy but they are valid in our modern world._

**Wabi-sabi: authentic & appealing**

A well-loved childhood toy, your favorite pair of faded jeans, a piece of rustic handmade pottery, a forest path covered in fallen autumn leaves, all embrace Wabi-sabi: the Japanese principle of the beauty of the "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete".\[1\] I embrace the idea that "nothing lasts forever, nothing is finished and nothing is perfect".\[2\] This is the essence of life itself; of nature. I believe that nature is the greatest teacher. Although the professional grade acrylic paint I use for most of my artwork may come close to lasting forever!

**Shibumi: effortless perfection**

It is an overarching concept, an ideal. It has no precise definition in Japanese, but its meaning is reserved for objects and experiences that exhibit in paradox and all at once the very best of everything and nothing: Elegant simplicity. Effortless effectiveness. Understated excellence. Beautiful imperfection. The word shibumi was first used in around 1336 in Japan. In his 1972 book, _The Unknown Craftsman_, Soetsu Yanagi talked about shibumi in the context of art, writing that a true work of art is one with intentionally imperfect beauty that makes an artist of the viewer. Impressionism is such work that is "intentionally imperfect" in that the image is not delineated with every line and detail, but requires the observer to complete it, additionally so when secret messages have been incorporated. I believe that this is the ideal of true art -- and life imitates art.

**Shinrin-yoku-bijutsu: nature-bathing through art**

Every week the modern North American spends 19.6 hours watching TV and 23 hours on email, text and social media.\[3,4\] All this time has to come from somewhere, so what are we giving up? A great deal of this is a direct response to the overwhelm of how we work (multi-tasking, trying to "do more with less"), which spills over into the rest of our lives. The true cost of always being "ON" and digitally connected can sneak up on you. What starts as feeling hyper-productive and hyper-connected is actually an addiction with serious repercussions. New Economy Depression Syndrome (NEDS) is a clinical syndrome associated with information overload, and results in anxiety, exhaustion, burnout, decision paralysis, sadness, irritability, and sleep problems.\[5\] Another one is Nature Deficit Disorder (NDD). It has very similar symptoms as NEDS (which are all symptoms of too much stress). Both NEDS and NDD (as well as stress in general) can be alleviated by **Shinrin-yoku**-- "nature-bathing". When you nature bathe, you connect with nature physically and emotionally. This has been proven with science to reduce stress and improve memory and your immune system.\[6\] I created the term Shinrin-yoku-_bijutsu _to describe **_nature-bathing through art _**("bijutsu" means art). Seeing gorgeous colors and images of nature can improve your mood, reduce stress and lower blood pressure.\[7\] Think about that the next time you put something on your walls. I believe that nature is the greatest healer -- and inspiration. I can't take you into the woods -- at least at this moment, but I can bring nature to you in a beautiful piece of nature-inspired art.

**Ikigai: zest for life**

_Ikigai _is our reason for being, our raison d'Ãªtre. It is the fire that wakes us up in the morning. The prime directive in life is to find our own personal ikigai, our reason for being, and to wake up every day and fulfill that mission. I believe that finding a state of flow helps you find your ikigai because you are no longer imprisoned by the trappings of the human ego, including anxiety, overwhelm, lack of intuition and poor decision-making. Instead, tapping a flow state will increase your creativity, intuition, productivity and focus. 

I believe that art helps you find ikigai, because art helps you to feel greater peace, upliftment, fulfillment and happiness. Combine art + flow, and you will have the clarity and peace you require to find your own ikigai (if not, connect with me and we can find it together!). 

And, of course, _this _IS my ikigai!

**Shizen: naturalness**

The goal of _shizen _is equilibrium between being "of nature" yet distinct from it---to be viewed as being without pretense or artifice, while seeming intentional rather than accidental or haphazard. 

My art is intended to re-create and abstract nature's sensations: light filtering through trees, the setting sun, shadows of passing clouds, with a desire to go beyond literal transcription of nature. 

I believe that the combination of nature (including in art) + flow unite to heighten shizen.

**Yugen: subtlety**

The principle of _yugen _captures the Zen view that precision and finiteness are at odds with nature, implying stagnation and loss of life, and that the power of suggestion is often stronger than that of full disclosure. Leaving something to the imagination piques our curiosity and can move us to engage on a deeper level. 

Impressionism demonstrates yugen subtlety in that the image does not depict every line and detail, but requires the observer to complete it. In addition, add a secret message to the artwork, and the subtle mystery, the yugen, increases.

**Fukinsei: ****imperfection, asymmetry**

The goal of _fukinsei_ is to convey the symmetry of the natural world through clearly asymmetrical and incomplete renderings. The effect is that the viewer supplies the missing symmetry and participates in the creative act. When you complete the painting, and discover the secret message, in your own mind, instead of relying on all the details being supplied, you co-create with the artist (me!). 

**Datsuzoku: break from routine**

Datsuzoku signifies an interruption from habit, or the "tried and true". When a well-worn pattern is broken, creativity and resourcefulness emerge. This disruption is an important part of any breakthrough, and helps you to awaken from the routine, the hamster wheel of daily life. 

My artwork breaks from routine impressionist paintings through natural abstraction (an abstracted image from the natural environment, rather than a forced or invented abstraction), and expressive brushwork and knifework. 

And then it REALLY breaks from routine by including secret messages!

So now it's your turn to break from your routine, and from predictable wall art, and try something new and creative!

**Seijaku:__stillness, ****tranquility**

The principle of _seijaku_ deals with the actual substance of datsuzoku. To the Zen practitioner, it is in states of active calm, tranquillity, solitude, and quietude that we find the essence of creative energy. This can be achieved through [meditation][0], which is an extremely effective way to enhance self-awareness, focus, and attention, and to prime your brain for achieving creative insights.[Meditation is used by many successful leaders][1] at Fortune 500 companies like GE, 3M, Google, and Apple. I believe in the healing powers of meditation. I've witnessed it firsthand! 

And while meditation is wonderful

## About Keena (the long version)

I am, at heart, an explorer, an adventurer, a seeker. My decidedly biggest fault, or perhaps attribute, is that I am intensely curious.

> Curiosity killed the cat.... And satisfaction brought her back!

That means I ask a lot of questions.... and get a lot of answers. I love research and the thrill of discovery. And I know a lot. Not about everything, just about the stuff I am personally interested in. It all started one sunny summer day when I was 3 and a half years old. We lived on a quiet, dead-end street with woods and a pond nearby. My best friend Carla's brother had showed her where the frogs had laid eggs in the pond and the tadpoles were hatching! The questions began. How do animals that look like fish grow legs?

At six years old, I asked my dad, "What happens when you die?" Needless to say, the vague and cagey answer fueled more questions! And I wasn't afraid of the big ones either!

Who are we?

Why are we here?

How did we get here?

What is this place? How did the earth get here?

Why is there no life on other planets nearby (i.e., where are all the aliens?!)?

What is the nature of the universe?

What is the nature of reality?

And on and on. My learning always had a 3-pronged approach: science (but, as I found out science didn't know all the answers), intuition, and art. I am a synaesthetic, highly sensitive, and empathic visual-spatial thinker. I NEED the right-brain to understand a subject holistically. Learning in an auditory, linear step-wise fashion (i.e, school) bored me out of my mind. So I learned more interesting stuff on my own and in my own way. Each thing a piece of the puzzle that illuminated for me how the world worked. Creativity and art allowed my to see the high-level links between the pieces of my puzzle.

I learned painting (because art was my first love, and something I cannot live without). I studied the sciences -- biology, ecology, zoology, evolution, ethology, psychology, and quantum physics. I studied the unseen realms (because science could not account for experiences of an otherworldly nature, and the things you just "know") -- intuition, paranormal phenomena, channeling and energy work, the spirit realms and all kinds of "woo". I studied world spiritual philosophies and mythologies, but really felt drawn to Taoism and Zen.

I studied business because I wanted to learn how to make a living doing art -- and found it very compelling in and of itself. I taught myself graphic and web design to make my business ideas come to life (business is a great form of creativity!). And in the course of all this learned that I loved coaching -- the curiosity questions, the insights, and of course it's all about discovery and exploration. The result was also degrees and certifications in most of this!

* Meaning Coach (Dr. Eric Maisel)

I tell you this only to explain how someone comes to be integrating art, intuition, science, energy healing, business and coaching together! Believe me, I was a long time in finding this path, only rather, it found me!

What brought it all together was a typical question asked by coaches helping you find your life's purpose. "What is it about the world that makes you angry; that you'd want to change?" The answer to that is, for me, consciousness. But that's pretty high level stuff. Bringing that down to earth, it comes down to Essence. Knowing the essence of who you are underneath all the trappings of industrialized, technologized culture, and what you "do", and what stuff you have. It's about knowing your Wild Soul. And then living in accordance with that -- with authenticity.

It's about re-wilding your life and work, re-storing the holistic ecosystem of your life to a properly functioning condition (because when one thing is not functioning, the whole thing is out of whack).

Why? So you can experience a LOT less stress, and a LOT MORE happiness, freedom, fulfillment, clarity, purpose and peace. When people have this raised level of consciousness and compassion, the whole world benefits.

Why is this important to me? Well, from the time I was little I saw the adults around me stressed and unhappy. They felt overworked, overwhelmed, and unable to cope with much of life and work. Some resorted to alcoholism to try to cope. Others to martyrdom in the name of what they they thought they "should" do. Much of this is a product of that generation having grown up during an era of World Wars. There were not many options for fulfillment on a personal level. As a kid, I tried my best to help them cope -- and naturally did a lot of research on how to help them.

This spilled over into my adult years as well, having a husband with high anxiety, and continuing with mom throughout her working years. People (at home, at university, at work) always asked me, "_How are you so calm?!_" It was just one of those things that I never really thought about, but that people relied on me for -- calm, peaceful energy, and support.

The stress killed my mom. And I don't want to see that happen to anyone else! Her death in 2015 was what crystallized this whole thing for me. My grief burned away all of the non-essentials, and coalesced this vision. This is how I want to spend the rest of my time here. I want to make a difference for all of you who are suffering from stress, burnout, overwhelm and all the other issues that come from not awakening your Wild Soul. And when it comes to why I focus on helping women executives and managers, professionals and entrepreneurs, it's because they have the greatest levels of stress and could benefit the most from what I offer. These are the women, like my mom, who try to do it all, and be everything to everyone. And please, it's really not about time-management, organization, or decluttering your inbox. It goes much, MUCH deeper... 

In love and gratitude, Keena
