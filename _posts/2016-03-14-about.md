## Guiding Principles

These values are the principles that guide my company and my artwork, and that is the lodestar that attracts clients and art-lovers._Note: Wild Soul's values may be rooted in Eastern philosophy but they are valid in our modern world._

**Wabi-sabi: authentic & appealing**

A well-loved childhood toy, your favorite pair of faded jeans, a piece of rustic handmade pottery, a forest path covered in fallen autumn leaves, all embrace Wabi-sabi: the Japanese principle of the beauty of the "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete".\[1\] I embrace the idea that "nothing lasts forever, nothing is finished and nothing is perfect".\[2\] This is the essence of life itself; of nature. I believe that nature is the greatest teacher. Although the professional grade acrylic paint I use for most of my artwork may come close to lasting forever!

**Shibumi: effortless perfection**

It is an overarching concept, an ideal. It has no precise definition in Japanese, but its meaning is reserved for objects and experiences that exhibit in paradox and all at once the very best of everything and nothing: Elegant simplicity. Effortless effectiveness. Understated excellence. Beautiful imperfection. The word shibumi was first used in around 1336 in Japan. In his 1972 book, _The Unknown Craftsman_, Soetsu Yanagi talked about shibumi in the context of art, writing that a true work of art is one with intentionally imperfect beauty that makes an artist of the viewer. Impressionism is such work that is "intentionally imperfect" in that the image is not delineated with every line and detail, but requires the observer to complete it, additionally so when secret messages have been incorporated. I believe that this is the ideal of true art -- and life imitates art.

**Shinrin-yoku-bijutsu: nature-bathing through art**

Every week the modern North American spends 19.6 hours watching TV and 23 hours on email, text and social media.\[3,4\] All this time has to come from somewhere, so what are we giving up? A great deal of this is a direct response to the overwhelm of how we work (multi-tasking, trying to "do more with less"), which spills over into the rest of our lives. The true cost of always being "ON" and digitally connected can sneak up on you. What starts as feeling hyper-productive and hyper-connected is actually an addiction with serious repercussions. New Economy Depression Syndrome (NEDS) is a clinical syndrome associated with information overload, and results in anxiety, exhaustion, burnout, decision paralysis, sadness, irritability, and sleep problems.\[5\] Another one is Nature Deficit Disorder (NDD). It has very similar symptoms as NEDS (which are all symptoms of too much stress). Both NEDS and NDD (as well as stress in general) can be alleviated by **Shinrin-yoku**-- "nature-bathing". When you nature bathe, you connect with nature physically and emotionally. This has been proven with science to reduce stress and improve memory and your immune system.\[6\] I created the term Shinrin-yoku-_bijutsu _to describe **_nature-bathing through art _**("bijutsu" means art). Seeing gorgeous colors and images of nature can improve your mood, reduce stress and lower blood pressure.\[7\] Think about that the next time you put something on your walls. I believe that nature is the greatest healer -- and inspiration. I can't take you into the woods -- at least at this moment, but I can bring nature to you in a beautiful piece of nature-inspired art.

**Ikigai: zest for life**

_Ikigai _is our reason for being, our raison d'Ãªtre. It is the fire that wakes us up in the morning. The prime directive in life is to find our own personal ikigai, our reason for being, and to wake up every day and fulfill that mission. I believe that finding a state of flow helps you find your ikigai because you are no longer imprisoned by the trappings of the human ego, including anxiety, overwhelm, lack of intuition and poor decision-making. Instead, tapping a flow state will increase your creativity, intuition, productivity and focus. 

I believe that art helps you find ikigai, because art helps you to feel greater peace, upliftment, fulfillment and happiness. Combine art + flow, and you will have the clarity and peace you require to find your own ikigai (if not, connect with me and we can find it together!). 

And, of course, _this _IS my ikigai!

**Shizen: naturalness**

The goal of _shizen _is equilibrium between being "of nature" yet distinct from it---to be viewed as being without pretense or artifice, while seeming intentional rather than accidental or haphazard. 

My art is intended to re-create and abstract nature's sensations: light filtering through trees, the setting sun, shadows of passing clouds, with a desire to go beyond literal transcription of nature. 

I believe that the combination of nature (including in art) + flow unite to heighten shizen.

**Yugen: subtlety**

The principle of _yugen _captures the Zen view that precision and finiteness are at odds with nature, implying stagnation and loss of life, and that the power of suggestion is often stronger than that of full disclosure. Leaving something to the imagination piques our curiosity and can move us to engage on a deeper level. 

Impressionism demonstrates yugen subtlety in that the image does not depict every line and detail, but requires the observer to complete it. In addition, add a secret message to the artwork, and the subtle mystery, the yugen, increases.

**Fukinsei: ****imperfection, asymmetry**

The goal of _fukinsei_ is to convey the symmetry of the natural world through clearly asymmetrical and incomplete renderings. The effect is that the viewer supplies the missing symmetry and participates in the creative act. When you complete the painting, and discover the secret message, in your own mind, instead of relying on all the details being supplied, you co-create with the artist (me!). 

**Datsuzoku: break from routine**

Datsuzoku signifies an interruption from habit, or the "tried and true". When a well-worn pattern is broken, creativity and resourcefulness emerge. This disruption is an important part of any breakthrough, and helps you to awaken from the routine, the hamster wheel of daily life. 

My artwork breaks from routine impressionist paintings through natural abstraction (an abstracted image from the natural environment, rather than a forced or invented abstraction), and expressive brushwork and knifework. 

And then it REALLY breaks from routine by including secret messages!

So now it's your turn to break from your routine, and from predictable wall art, and try something new and creative!

**Seijaku:__stillness, ****tranquility**

The principle of _seijaku_ deals with the actual substance of datsuzoku. To the Zen practitioner, it is in states of active calm, tranquillity, solitude, and quietude that we find the essence of creative energy. This can be achieved through [meditation][0], which is an extremely effective way to enhance self-awareness, focus, and attention, and to prime your brain for achieving creative insights.[Meditation is used by many successful leaders][1] at Fortune 500 companies like GE, 3M, Google, and Apple. I believe in the healing powers of meditation. I've witnessed it firsthand! 

And while meditation is wonderful, it's not the only way to access a state of flow! Want to know more? Stay tuned to my blog where I write about harnessing flow for greater creativity, intuition and productivity in art, life and business.

## About Keena (the long version)

I am, at heart, an explorer, an adventurer, a seeker. My decidedly biggest fault, or perhaps attribute, is that I am intensely curious.

> Curiosity killed the cat.... And satisfaction brought her back!

That means I ask a lot of questions.... and get a lot of answers. I love research and the thrill of discovery. And I know a lot. Not about everything, just about the stuff I am personally interested in. It all started one sunny summer day when I was 3 and a half years old. We lived on a quiet, dead-end street with woods and a pond nearby. My best friend Carla's brother had showed her where the frogs had laid eggs in the pond and the tadpoles were hatching! The questions began. How do animals that look like fish grow legs?

At six years old, I asked my dad, "What happens when you die?" Needless to say, the vague and cagey answer fueled more questions! And I wasn't afraid of the big ones either!

Who are we?

Why are we here?

How did we get here?

What is this place? How did the earth get here?

Why is there no life on other planets nearby (i.e., where are all the aliens?!)?

What is the nature of the universe?

What is the nature of reality?

And on and on. My learning always had a 3-pronged approach: science (but, as I found out science didn't know all the answers), intuition, and art. I am a synaesthetic, highly sensitive, and empathic visual-spatial thinker. I NEED the right-brain to understand a subject holistically. Learning in an auditory, linear step-wise fashion (i.e, school) bored me out of my mind. So I learned more interesting stuff on my own and in my own way. Each thing a piece of the puzzle that illuminated for me how the world worked. Creativity and art allowed my to see the high-level links between the pieces of my puzzle.

I learned painting (because art was my first love, and something I cannot live without). I studied the sciences -- biology, ecology, zoology, evolution, ethology, psychology, and quantum physics. I studied the unseen realms (because science could not account for experiences of an otherworldly nature, and the things you just "know") -- intuition, paranormal phenomena, channeling and energy work, the spirit realms and all kinds of "woo". I studied world spiritual philosophies and mythologies, but really felt drawn to Taoism and Zen.

I studied business because I wanted to learn how to make a living doing art -- and found it very compelling in and of itself. I taught myself graphic and web design to make my business ideas come to life (business is a great form of creativity!). And in the course of all this learned that I loved coaching -- the curiosity questions, the insights, and of course it's all about discovery and exploration. The result was also degrees and certifications in most of this!

* Hons. B.Sc. in biology (University of Guelph, Ontario)
* Certified Professional (life and business) Coach (AUNLP)
* Certified Soul Realignment practitioner (Akashic records)
* Certified Soul Realignment for Business and Financial Abundance practitioner (Akashic records)
* Certified Divinely Guided Life Coach
* Reiki Master
* Orin and DaBen Light Body graduate
* Orin and DaBen Channeling graduate
* Art awards, and the honour of exhibiting in a group show with my art hero, Robert Bateman, at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, BC.
* The self-taught equivalent of an MBA in business (20 years learning & experience in branding and marketing)
* Graphic design and web design since 1997
* Meaning Coach (Dr. Eric Maisel)

I tell you this only to explain how someone comes to be integrating art, intuition, science, energy healing, business and coaching together! Believe me, I was a long time in finding this path, only rather, it found me!

Then I read Steven Kotler's book, **_The Rise of Superman_**. I was very interested in learning greater reliability of flow states to use in my art.

## What I discovered is that I am a **flow seeker**! (I even named my kayak that). 

It is **THE thing that connects my passions **for **_creativity_** (art, design, business, science), **_discovery_** (learning, self-discovery, exploration & adventure), **_intuitive and spiritual explorations_** (energy work, channeling and other intuitive work, coaching, meditation) and **_adventure_** (hiking, cycling, camping, kayaking, snorkeling, and as a biologist getting chased by a grizzly) and _a bit of thrill-seeking I'd love to try but haven't yet_. 

I also realized this quest for flow, for creative mastery, even accounts for the **_rapid progression of my art styles_** over the last 15 years (versus the first 25). It's like a surfer's quest to master the ever-bigger waves. 

So now, I help those _amazing and wonderful people who wish to express themselves through art and harness flow in their art, life and business_.

In love and gratitude, Keena
