Just released a new word painting of an Aspen forest in springtime. I love the bright lime greens and lavender blue-purples. 

Within it is the **secret message,** a quote by Vincent Van Gogh: "I have nature, art and poetry. If this is not enough, what is enough?"

The painting is 12x12 inches, acrylics on canvas. Available! $398 including North America-wide shipping. Please contact me to purchase.
