# Autumn Glory - Grizzlies

In this palette knife oil painting (16x20 inches), I created an abstract environment based on the hill topography of the area just east of the Rockies. ![Details of bears](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cdcdd1a3-0f3b-4573-ab5f-85ae5ab12316.jpg)

The entire painting is quite abstract, even the bears. I love how your mind "fills in the missing pieces" to "read" the abstraction as landscape and bears.
